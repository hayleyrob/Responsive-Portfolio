# Responsive-Portfolio
Responsive Portfolio Assignment
This is my portfolio website. I currently do not have portfolio items I would like to showcase, so I added in a placeholder for the photo and the portfolio item information. Since the divs and columns within Bootstrap are created to be responsive, I didn't include any @media snippets.
